## 📝 Key Concepts

### 1. Hello, World! 🌍
Write your first Python program:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### 2. Variables and Data Types
Learn how to store and manage data:
```python
# Numbers
a = 42  # Integer
b = 3.14  # Float

# Text
name = "Python"

# Boolean
is_fun = True
```

### 3. Conditional Statements

x = 10
y = 20
if x > y:
    print("x is greater")
else:
    print("y is greater")
```

### 4. Loops
Automate repetitive tasks:
#### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
#### While Loop:
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### 5. Functions
Encapsulate reusable logic:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```
