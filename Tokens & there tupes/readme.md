# 🫠 Tokens and Their Types - Python Project

This project dives deep into the world of **tokens** in Python 👨‍💻. Tokens are the building blocks that the Python interpreter understands, and mastering them is essential for becoming proficient in Python! This interactive project offers a detailed and fun exploration of Python tokens.

## 📖 Introduction

In Python, **tokens** are the smallest units of meaningful code that the interpreter reads and understands. Think of them as the building blocks of Python syntax. Each token plays a crucial role in making Python code functional and readable. Just like words form sentences, tokens form Python programs.

## 💡 What are Tokens?

A **token** is like a small instruction for the Python interpreter. It represents the basic element of the code, whether it's a keyword, variable, operator, or a piece of raw data. The interpreter reads these tokens one by one and uses them to execute the program.

## 🔢 Types of Tokens

Python has several types of tokens, each serving a specific purpose in the code. Here's a breakdown:

### 🔑 Keywords

Reserved words that have predefined meanings in Python. These words are like commands that guide the program's behavior. Examples include:

- `if`, `else`, `while`, `def`, `return`, `for`

### 🔎 Identifiers

These are user-defined names used for variables, functions, classes, and other objects. Identifiers make code more understandable and reusable. Examples:

- `my_variable`, `calculate_area`

### 📈 Literals

Fixed values directly written in the code. These can be numbers, strings, or boolean values. Examples:

- `42` (integer), `"Hello World!"` (string), `True` (boolean)

### ➕ Operators

Symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They act as tools for manipulating data. Examples include:

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

### 🔹 Separators

Characters that separate different elements in the code. These keep the code structure organized. Examples include:

- Parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, commas `,`, colons `:`

### 💬 Comments

Non-executable lines used to explain or annotate the code. Comments are for humans, not the interpreter! Examples:

```python
# This is a comment
```

**Pro Tip**: Use comments generously to make your code easier to understand!
