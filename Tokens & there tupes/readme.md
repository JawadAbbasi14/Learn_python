Tokens and Their Types - Python Project
This project dives deep into the world of tokens in Python Ô∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Tokens are the building blocks that the Python interpreter understands, and understanding them is key to mastering Python! Here, we'll explore the different types with a fun, interactive approach.

Introduction
In Python, tokens are the smallest units of meaningful code that the interpreter reads and understands. Just like words make up sentences, tokens make up Python code. Different types of tokens have different roles, making the code function smoothly.

What are Tokens?
Think of a token like a tiny instruction for the Python interpreter. Each token tells it a specific thing to do, like using a variable, comparing values, or printing something to the screen. The interpreter reads these tokens one by one and assembles them into a program it can understand and execute.

Token Types Breakdown Ô∏è
Python has a variety of token types, each with its own special job. Let's explore the most common ones:

Keywords

These are reserved words with a predefined meaning in Python, like if, for, while, def, etc. They act as the commands that tell the program what to do.

Identifiers üÜî
These are user-defined names given to variables, functions, classes, or other objects. They help us refer to things in our code without repeating long descriptions. Think of them as personalized labels!

Literals

These are fixed values that appear directly in the code. Examples include numbers like 5, strings like "Hello World!", and booleans like True or False. They represent the raw data our program works with.

Operators ‚ûï
These are symbols used to perform operations on variables and literals. They're like the tools that help us manipulate data. Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >), and logical operators (and, or, not).

Separators

These are characters that separate different parts of the code and keep things organized. Examples include parentheses (), brackets [], and commas ,. They act like punctuation marks for our code.

Comments

These are non-executable lines of code that provide explanations or notes about the code. They're like little messages for ourselves or other developers reading the code.

Pro Tip: Comments don't get executed by the Python interpreter, but they're super helpful for understanding the code later!

Get Started!
To run this project locally and explore tokens yourself, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokens-and-types.git
Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username.

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd tokens-and-types
(Optional) Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
Install dependencies (if any):

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:

Bash

python tokens_and_types.py
Let's Play with Tokens! Ô∏è
Once the project is running, it will provide interactive examples and explanations of each token type. You can experiment with different tokens and see how Python interprets them.
