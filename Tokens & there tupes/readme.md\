# Tokens and Their Types - Python Project

This project explores **tokens** in Python programming, specifically focusing on the different types of tokens used in Python's syntax. It provides an interactive approach to understanding how Python interprets code by breaking it down into different token types.

## Introduction

In Python, **tokens** are the smallest units of meaningful code that the Python interpreter understands. Tokens are classified into several types, including keywords, operators, identifiers, literals, and more. This project provides an overview and examples of each type.

## What are Tokens?

A token is a string of characters that represents a basic element of syntax. Tokens are the building blocks of Python code. The Python interpreter breaks down the code into tokens for easier understanding and execution.

## Types of Tokens

Python code can be broken down into the following types of tokens:

1. **Keywords** üîë  
   Reserved words that have a special meaning in Python, like `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, etc.

2. **Identifiers** üÜî  
   Names used to identify variables, functions, classes, or other objects. Example: `my_variable`, `calculate_area`.

3. **Literals** üî¢  
   Fixed values used directly in the code, such as numbers, strings, or boolean values. Example: `5`, `"Hello World"`, `True`.

4. **Operators** ‚ûï  
   Symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Examples include arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, and comparison operators like `==`, `>`.

5. **Separators** üìè  
   Characters that separate statements or different elements in the code. Examples include parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and commas `,`.

6. **Comments** üí¨  
   Non-executable code used to explain or annotate the code. In Python, comments are written using `#`. Example: `# This is a comment`.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tokens-and-types.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tokens-and-types
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the project:

   ```bash
   python tokens_and_types.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the project is running, it will display various examples of different types of tokens in Python. You can modify the code to experiment with different tokens and see how Python interprets them.

## Contributing
